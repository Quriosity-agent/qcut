# Infinite Render Loop Investigation Guide

## 📊 INVESTIGATION SUMMARY

**🔴 Problem**: Infinite render loop warning in QCut video editor
**🎯 Root Cause**: ResizablePanel system from `react-resizable-panels` library
**📍 Location**: Component `fl` in MediaPanel container during layout initialization
**⚡ Status**: Root cause identified, fix in progress

### **Investigation Timeline:**
- **v1-v4**: Fixed CSP, useEffect dependencies, React optimizations
- **v5**: Systematically tested all major UI components (all SAFE)
- **v6**: Tested TimelinePlayhead and complex components (all SAFE) 
- **v7**: Tested root components EditorPage & EditorProvider (all SAFE)
- **v8**: Added hook debugging - **BREAKTHROUGH**: No hooks show excessive renders
- **Result**: Component `fl` identified as ResizablePanel causing infinite loop

## Error Pattern
```
Warning: Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component calls setState inside useEffect, but useEffect either doesn't have a dependency array, or one of the dependencies changes on every render.
    at fl (ResizablePanel component)
    at jc (MediaPanel container)  
    at Panel/PanelGroup (react-resizable-panels)
```

- ✅ `apps/web/src/components/editor/properties-panel/index.tsx` - 11 renders (SAFE)

## Verification Steps

### Step 1: Add Debug Logging
Add this to suspected components:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log(`[ComponentName] Effect triggered at ${Date.now()}`);
  // existing effect code
}, [dependencies]);
```

### Step 2: Check Dependency Stability
For each useEffect, verify:
1. No inline objects: `{}` or `[]`
2. No inline functions: `() => {}`
3. No unstable references from stores
4. Proper memoization of callbacks

### Step 3: Common Patterns to Fix

#### Pattern 1: Unstable Function References
```typescript
// BAD
const someFunction = () => { /* ... */ };
useEffect(() => {
  someFunction();
}, [someFunction]); // Creates infinite loop

// GOOD
const someFunction = useCallback(() => { /* ... */ }, []);
useEffect(() => {
  someFunction();
}, [someFunction]); // Stable reference
```

#### Pattern 2: Object Dependencies
```typescript
// BAD
useEffect(() => {
  // ...
}, [{ key: value }]); // New object every render

// GOOD
const config = useMemo(() => ({ key: value }), [value]);
useEffect(() => {
  // ...
}, [config]); // Stable reference
```

#### Pattern 3: Store Selectors
```typescript
// BAD
const getData = useStore(s => s.getData); // Function recreated
useEffect(() => {
  getData();
}, [getData]); // Infinite loop

// GOOD
const data = useStore(s => s.data); // Select data directly
useEffect(() => {
  // use data
}, [data]); // Stable value
```

## Testing Strategy

1. **Isolate Components**: Comment out components one by one
2. **Monitor Console**: Look for rapid repeated logs
3. **React DevTools**: Use Profiler to identify components rendering excessively
4. **Add Breakpoints**: Set breakpoints in useEffect to catch loops

## Current Status

### ✅ Fixed Issues:
- ✅ AI generation elapsed time timer (reduced from 1s to 5s)
- ✅ Timeline getTotalDuration dependency (using tracks instead of function)
- ✅ AudioWaveform cleanup and memoization
- ✅ AiView component memoization

### ✅ ALL Major Components Verified SAFE (v5-v7 console logs):

**UI Components (v5):**
- **Timeline**: 10 renders ✅ | **MediaPanel**: 7 renders ✅ | **PreviewPanel**: 12 renders ✅
- **PropertiesPanel**: 11 renders ✅ | **PreviewToolbar**: 11 renders ✅ | **AudioPlayer**: 3 renders ✅  
- **TimelineTrack** (multiple): 2-8 renders each ✅ | **AudioWaveform**: 3 renders ✅

**Complex Components (v6):**
- **TimelinePlayhead**: 12 renders ✅ (NOT the culprit despite complex logic!)

**Root Components (v7):**
- **EditorProvider**: 9 renders ✅ | **EditorPage**: 7 renders ✅

### 🚨 V10 BREAKTHROUGH - PANEL NORMALIZATION FIX SUCCESSFUL!
```
Warning: Maximum update depth exceeded at al 
(file:///editor._project_id.lazy-DPQruEQc.js:13:102801)
```

**✅ PANEL NORMALIZATION FIX PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL:**
- ✅ **Component changed from `fl` to `al`** - Different component now causing the issue
- ✅ **Panel normalization removal** reduced the problem but didn't eliminate it completely
- ❌ **New culprit identified** - Component `al` is still triggering infinite loops
- ❌ **Rapid re-rendering detected** across ALL components - systemic issue remains

**🔍 V10 ANALYSIS - CRITICAL EVIDENCE:**
- ❌ **ALL components showing rapid re-rendering** - MediaPanel, PreviewPanel, PropertiesPanel, TimelinePlayhead, etc.
- ❌ **Renders happening within 0-30ms intervals** - This indicates a broader state management issue
- ❌ **Multiple components rendering simultaneously** - Suggests shared state causing cascading updates
- ❌ **Pattern shows 1-12 renders per component** - Not infinite, but excessive

**🔍 V10 NEW PATTERN DISCOVERED:**
- 🚨 **Rapid re-rendering burst at startup** (lines 1-27) - MediaPanel, PreviewPanel, PropertiesPanel render 3-4 times in quick succession
- 🚨 **Component chains triggering together** - When one renders, others follow within milliseconds
- 🚨 **Timeline components also affected** - TimelinePlayhead, TimelineTrack showing rapid renders
- 🚨 **Audio components caught in the loop** - AudioPlayer, AudioWaveform also rapid rendering

## Complete List of Files with useEffect Hooks

### ⚠️ NEW SUSPECTS - Small/Utility Components:
Since ALL major components are SAFE, `fl` must be:
1. **Resizable Panel Components** - Used throughout the layout
2. **Dialog/Modal Components** - Onboarding, alerts, etc.
3. **Small UI Utilities** - Tooltips, dropdowns, etc.
4. **Third-party library wrappers** - Radix UI, etc.

### ⚠️ HOOKS - NEED TESTING
11. [ ] `hooks/use-timeline-playhead.ts` - **Playhead position updates**
12. [ ] `hooks/use-timeline-element-resize.ts` - Element resize handling
13. [ ] `hooks/use-timeline-zoom.ts` - Zoom level changes
14. [ ] `hooks/use-async-media-store.ts` - Media store loading
15. [ ] `hooks/use-async-ffmpeg.ts` - FFmpeg initialization
16. [ ] `hooks/use-sound-search.ts` - Sound search API calls
17. [ ] `hooks/use-export-settings.ts` - Export configuration
18. [ ] `hooks/use-debounce.ts` - Debounced values
19. [ ] `hooks/use-blob-image.ts` - Blob URL management

### ⚠️ STICKERS OVERLAY - NEED TESTING
20. [ ] `components/editor/stickers-overlay/StickerCanvas.tsx`
21. [ ] `components/editor/stickers-overlay/AutoSave.tsx`
22. [ ] `components/editor/stickers-overlay/hooks/useStickerDrag.ts`

### ⚠️ OTHER COMPONENTS - NEED TESTING
23. [ ] `components/storage-provider.tsx` - Storage initialization
24. [ ] `components/editor-provider.tsx` - Editor context
25. [ ] `components/onboarding.tsx` - Onboarding flow
26. [ ] `components/export-canvas.tsx` - Export rendering

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS - Focus on ResizablePanel System:

**CONFIRMED TARGET:** ResizablePanel components are causing the infinite loop

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. **Examine ResizablePanel usage** in EditorPage layout (lines 214-280)
2. **Check react-resizable-panels library** for known issues with panel size calculations
3. **Look for useEffect dependencies** in panel onResize handlers
4. **Add debug logging** to all panel onResize callbacks

### **Likely Root Cause:**
- Panel size calculations creating dependency loops
- onResize callbacks triggering state updates that cause re-renders
- Unstable panel size references in useEffect dependencies

## 🔴 Component 'fl' IDENTIFIED:
- **ResizablePanel component** from react-resizable-panels library
- **Triggers during layout initialization** when panels calculate sizes
- **Located in MediaPanel container** (component `jc`)
- **Caused by panel size/resize handling**

## 🎯 NEXT INVESTIGATION STEPS - Shared State Analysis

### **COMPLETED STEPS:**
- ✅ **Step 1**: Panel onResize handlers analyzed - callbacks working correctly
- ✅ **Step 2**: Added debug logging to all panel callbacks - no excessive calls detected  
- ✅ **Step 3**: Fixed normalizeHorizontalPanels dependency - **PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL** (changed component from `fl` to `al`)
- ✅ **Step 4**: Confirmed panel setters are stable and properly wrapped in useCallback
- ✅ **Step 5**: Library version investigation - react-resizable-panels v2.1.7 has known issues, latest is v3.0.4

### **NEW INVESTIGATION TARGET - Shared State Management:**

**🔍 Evidence from v10 Logs:**
- **BREAKTHROUGH**: Panel normalization fix changed the problematic component from `fl` to `al`
- **NEW PROBLEM**: ALL components showing rapid re-rendering (0-30ms intervals)
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Shared state causing cascading updates across entire component tree
- **PATTERN**: Components render in groups, suggesting shared dependencies

### **Step 1: Identify Shared State Dependencies** 🎯
```typescript
// Focus on stores used by multiple components:
1. useTimelineStore - Used by Timeline, TimelinePlayhead, TimelineTrack
2. usePlaybackStore - Used by PreviewPanel, TimelinePlayhead, MediaPanel
3. useProjectStore - Used by EditorPage and most child components
4. usePanelStore - Used by all panel components
```

### **Step 2: Check for Unstable Selectors** 🎯
```typescript
// Look for selector patterns that recreate objects/functions:
// BAD:
const data = useStore(s => ({ tracks: s.tracks, time: s.time })); // New object every render
const handler = useStore(s => s.getHandler); // Function reference

// GOOD:
const tracks = useStore(s => s.tracks); // Primitive/stable reference
const time = useStore(s => s.time);
```

### **Step 3: Analyze Component Mount/Update Chain** 🎯
```typescript
// Based on v10 logs, investigate why these render together:
1. MediaPanel → PreviewPanel → PropertiesPanel (synchronized renders)
2. TimelinePlayhead → TimelineTrack (coupled updates)
3. AudioPlayer → AudioWaveform (audio chain updates)
```

### **Step 4: Test Zustand Store Isolation** 🎯
```typescript
// Temporarily disable store subscriptions to isolate:
1. Comment out useTimelineStore calls in Timeline components
2. Use static data instead of store subscriptions
3. Test if rapid rendering stops
```

## 🚨 HIGH PRIORITY FIXES

### **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**

1. **🔥 CRITICAL: Fix Shared State Selectors**
   - Audit all Zustand store selectors for object/function recreation
   - Replace unstable selectors with stable primitive selections
   - Add selector memoization where needed

2. **📦 LIBRARY UPGRADE**
   - Upgrade react-resizable-panels from v2.1.7 to v3.0.4
   - Test if library upgrade resolves remaining "al" component infinite loop

3. **⚡ COMPONENT ISOLATION**
   - Break dependency chains between MediaPanel → PreviewPanel → PropertiesPanel
   - Isolate Timeline component updates from main UI updates
   - Add React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders

4. **🛡️ STATE UPDATE DEBOUNCING**
   - Add debouncing to rapid state updates (especially timeline/playback)
   - Implement update batching for related state changes
   - Use React 18's automatic batching more effectively

## Command to Run Tests
```bash
# Development mode with detailed logging
bun run electron:dev

# Production build to verify fix
bun run build && bun run electron
```

## v11 Analysis - CRITICAL: Tasks 1-6 Failed, Maximum Update Depth Error

The v11 logs reveal that **Tasks 1-6 implementation FAILED** - the optimization attempts have escalated the issue to React's maximum update depth limit.

### Critical Errors Found
1. **Maximum update depth exceeded** (line 54): React threw fatal error due to infinite setState calls
2. **getSnapshot infinite loop warning** (line 3): Still occurring despite selector fixes
3. **useEffect dependency array issue** (line 65): "Maximum update depth" in useEffect with changing dependencies

### Failure Analysis
- **Tasks 1-6 made the problem WORSE**, not better
- The store selector fixes created **NEW infinite loops** instead of fixing existing ones
- React is now **crashing with fatal errors** instead of just warnings

### Root Cause Evolution
**Original**: Panel library rapid re-rendering (0-30ms intervals)
**Current**: Store selector infinite loops causing React to hit maximum update depth

### Immediate Priority
**URGENT**: Revert all store selector changes from Tasks 1-6 and find the **actual source** of the infinite loops before attempting optimization.

## v12 Analysis - POST-REVERT: Original Problem Confirmed, Component Pattern Identified

The v12 logs confirm that **reverting Tasks 1-6 was successful** - we're back to the original problem state without the fatal React crashes.

### Key Findings
1. **Maximum update depth warning returned** (line 1): Back to `al` component warnings, not fatal crashes
2. **Original rapid re-rendering pattern restored** (lines 55-136): Multiple components rendering 1-50ms intervals
3. **Component interaction pattern identified**: PreviewToolbar → TimelinePlayhead → TimelineTrack cascade

### Specific Component Behavior Observed
- **PreviewToolbar**: 11 renders in rapid succession (12-33ms intervals)
- **TimelinePlayhead**: 4 renders triggered by PreviewToolbar changes
- **TimelineTrack**: Multiple track instances showing synchronized rendering (0-38ms intervals)
- **AudioPlayer**: 2 renders during component cascade

### Critical Pattern Discovery
**Component Chain Reaction**: PreviewToolbar renders trigger TimelinePlayhead, which triggers TimelineTrack instances, creating a cascade effect where each component change triggers others in rapid succession.

### Root Cause Narrowed Down
The issue is **NOT in store selectors** but in **component interdependencies** - when one timeline component updates, it triggers a chain reaction across related components.

## v13 Analysis - PARTIAL SUCCESS: Component Chain Broken, Core Issue Remains

The v13 logs show **significant improvement** but the root panel issue persists.

### Optimization Results
1. **Component chain partially broken** - TimelinePlayhead no longer in debug logs (RAF optimization working!)
2. **AudioPlayer removed from cascade** - No AudioPlayer warnings (ref-based sync successful!)
3. **Reduced rapid re-rendering** - PreviewToolbar and TimelineTrack still show warnings but less frequent
4. **Maximum update depth still present** - Component `al` still triggering warnings (lines 3, 57)

### What's Working
- **TimelinePlayhead**: Successfully using RAF animation, no re-renders during playback
- **AudioPlayer**: Ref-based sync eliminated re-renders
- **TimelineTrack**: Only re-rendering during initialization, not during playback

### What Still Needs Fixing
- **Component `al`**: Still causing maximum update depth warnings (likely in MediaPanel)
- **Initial render cascade**: Components still rapidly re-render during mount (lines 111-179)
- **PreviewToolbar**: Still showing 11 rapid renders during initialization

### Key Achievement
**Playback performance improved** - The optimization successfully removed the 60fps re-render cascade during playback. The remaining issues are initialization/mount related, not playback related.

## v14 Analysis - PROGRESS BUT NOT RESOLVED: Initialization Issue Persists

The v14 logs show that despite our debouncing efforts, the initialization issue persists.

### Current State
1. **Maximum update depth warning still present** (line 3): Component `al` still triggering
2. **Improved playback performance**: TimelinePlayhead and AudioPlayer no longer in logs
3. **Initialization cascade continues**: PreviewToolbar renders 11 times, TimelineTrack multiple times
4. **Pattern unchanged**: Rapid re-renders during mount (1-48ms intervals)

### What's Working
- **Playback optimizations successful**: RAF animations preventing 60fps re-renders
- **AudioPlayer isolated**: No longer part of the render cascade
- **TimelinePlayhead optimized**: Using RAF, not appearing in render logs

### What's NOT Working
- **Panel resize debouncing insufficient**: Still getting rapid updates during initialization
- **Component `al` unresolved**: Maximum update depth warning persists
- **ResizablePanel library issue**: Likely the root cause, as it's part of the react-resizable-panels v2.1.7

### Critical Finding
The debouncing helped but didn't eliminate the issue. The problem appears to be deeper in the ResizablePanel library itself, which has known issues with infinite loops in v2.1.7. The library upgrade to v3.0.4 may be necessary.

## Investigation Status
- ✅ **Root Cause Identified**: Shared state management causing cascading component updates
- ✅ **Panel Normalization Fix**: Partially successful - changed problematic component from `fl` to `al` 
- ✅ **Library Issues Confirmed**: react-resizable-panels v2.1.7 has known "Maximum update depth exceeded" bugs
- ❌ **Broader Issue Discovered**: ALL components showing rapid re-rendering (0-30ms intervals)
- ✅ **REVERT SUCCESSFUL**: Tasks 1-6 reverted, back to original problem state without crashes
- 🎯 **NEW DISCOVERY**: Component chain reaction pattern identified (PreviewToolbar → TimelinePlayhead → TimelineTrack)
- 🎯 **REFINED TARGET**: Component interdependencies causing cascade re-rendering, not store selectors
- ✅ **PARTIAL FIX SUCCESSFUL**: Phases 1-4 broke playback render chain, eliminated TimelinePlayhead and AudioPlayer from cascade
- ⚠️ **DEBOUNCING ATTEMPTED**: Added resize handler debouncing but initialization issue persists
- 🚨 **REMAINING ISSUE**: Component `al` still causing maximum update depth during initialization
- ✅ **v15 FIXES APPLIED**: 
  - Commented out debug logging useEffects in PreviewToolbar and TimelineTrack (missing dependency arrays)
  - Fixed ResizablePanel props: Changed `onResizeEnd` to `onResize`
  - Upgraded react-resizable-panels from v2.1.7 to v3.0.4
- ❌ **v16 RESULT**: Issue persists - component `al` still triggering maximum update depth warning

## v16 Analysis - LIBRARY UPGRADE INCOMPLETE: Issue Persists After Fixes

Despite upgrading react-resizable-panels to v3.0.4 and fixing debug logging, the issue persists.

### Current State After v15 Fixes:
1. **Maximum update depth warning continues** (line 1): Component `al` still triggering
2. **Library upgraded but issue remains**: v3.0.4 didn't resolve the infinite loop
3. **Debug logging disabled**: Removed problematic useEffects without dependency arrays
4. **Props corrected**: Fixed `onResizeEnd` → `onResize` in ResizablePanel components

### Critical Observation:
The minified component `al` is still unidentified. Since the library upgrade didn't fix it, the issue might be:
1. A different component entirely (not ResizablePanel)
2. A custom hook or store subscription
3. An interaction between the new library version and existing code

## 🎯 NEXT INVESTIGATION STEPS - Find Component `al`

### Step 1: Source Map Analysis
```bash
# Generate source maps for better debugging
cd qcut && bun run build --sourcemap
```

### Step 2: Add Development Build Debugging
```typescript
// In vite.config.ts, ensure development builds aren't minified:
build: {
  minify: false, // Temporarily disable for debugging
  sourcemap: true
}
```

### Step 3: Component Identification Strategy
1. **Use React DevTools Profiler** to identify which component is rendering excessively
2. **Add console.trace()** at the start of suspected components
3. **Binary search approach**: Comment out half the UI at a time to isolate

### Step 4: Check Panel Resize Handlers
Since the issue persists after library upgrade, examine the resize handler implementations:
```typescript
// Look for patterns like:
const handleResize = (sizes: number[]) => {
  // Check if this causes state updates that trigger re-renders
  setPanelSizes(sizes); // Could cause infinite loop if not properly memoized
};
```

### Step 5: Investigate Store Subscriptions
Component `al` might be a store subscriber with unstable selectors:
```typescript
// Check all useStore calls for:
1. Object/array returns without shallow comparison
2. Function selectors that recreate on each call
3. Computed values in selectors
```

## 🚨 URGENT NEXT ACTIONS

1. **Build with source maps** to identify component `al`
2. **Use React DevTools** to profile and find the problematic component
3. **Check all onResize handlers** for state updates causing loops
4. **Audit store subscriptions** for unstable selectors
5. **Consider reverting to v2.1.7** and applying a different fix if v3.0.4 introduced new issues
