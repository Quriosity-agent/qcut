# Git Ignore Note

## Files Ignored from Version Control

The following files in this directory are ignored by git (added to `.gitignore`):

- `implementation-summary.md` - Detailed implementation summary (local only)
- `complete-integration-guide.md` - Full integration guide with 10-minute tasks (local only)

These files contain detailed implementation notes and are kept locally for reference but not tracked in version control to avoid clutter.

## Files Still Tracked

The following files remain tracked:
- `README.md` - General description of the audio export feature
- `audio-export-feature-integration.md` - Public-facing integration overview
- `export-button.tsx` - Reference implementation from original commit
- `export.ts` - Reference implementation from original commit
- `export-types.ts` - Reference implementation from original commit
- `.gitignore-note.md` - This file

## Reason for Exclusion

The excluded files contain:
- Detailed implementation steps
- Internal technical decisions
- Development-specific notes
- Task breakdowns for developers

These are useful for local development but not necessary for the repository history.
