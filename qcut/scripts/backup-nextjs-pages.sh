# Next.js Pages Backup Restoration Instructions

Created: $(date)
Phase: 3.2.1 - Pre-cleanup backup

## Backup Contents

### Pages Backup
- File: $BACKUP_FILE
- Contains: apps/web/src/app/ directory
- Size: $(du -h "$BACKUP_FILE" | cut -f1)

### Config Backup  
- File: $CONFIG_BACKUP
- Contains: next.config.mjs, next-env.d.ts
- Location: apps/web/

## Restoration Commands

To restore Next.js pages if needed:

\`\`\`bash
# Restore app directory
tar -xzf "$BACKUP_FILE"

# Restore config files (if they exist)
if [ -f "$CONFIG_BACKUP" ]; then
    tar -xzf "$CONFIG_BACKUP" -C apps/web/
fi
\`\`\`

## Verification

After restoration, verify with:
\`\`\`bash
ls -la apps/web/src/app/
ls -la apps/web/next*
\`\`\`

## Note

These files were unused legacy components. TanStack Router handles all routing functionality.
Restoration should only be needed for reference purposes.
