Read the skill at .claude/skills/codex-delegate/SKILL.md, then evaluate the user's task:

1. Decide: should this be done by you (Claude Code) or delegated to Codex?
2. Print your reasoning in 1-2 lines.
3. If delegating: construct the Codex prompt following the skill's template (include branch, files, criteria, constraints, verification commands), then run it.
4. If handling yourself: proceed directly with implementation.
