## Delete Earlier, Keep Later / 删前保后

The later version is usually more complete:
- Delete the earlier part (errors/fragments)
- Keep the later part (complete sentence)

后说的通常更完整：
- 删除前面的（口误/残句）
- 保留后面的（完整句）

## Exceptions / 例外

- User explicitly says "the later one sounds better" → delete earlier, keep later
- User explicitly says "the earlier one sounds better" → delete later, keep earlier
